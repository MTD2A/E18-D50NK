# E18-D50NK binary infrared reflection sensor

Among the tested IR binary reflection sensors, the E18-D50NK is definitely the best. It has a simple construction and the distance can be adjusted. It is suitable for vertical mounting under rails, it reflects matte black objects, it works in direct sunlight (but should always be placed in the shade), it can be used in humid environments (but is not waterproof), it is easy to program in Arduino, and it is easy to clean. Measuring distance can be adjusted with a screw.
